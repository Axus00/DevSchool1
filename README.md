DevSchool
Industry Niche: Technology Education
Market Focus: Enhancing online education for users, with a specific focus on technology-related courses.

Presentation: It's up to each individual to present it as they feel most comfortable (in English).

For us, it is a pleasure to present this new proposal, which arises from the need evident in the education sector on specialized web platforms for this type of education, such as (Platzi, Udemy, BIQ). We will assist all types of users without discrimination based on religion, belief, socioeconomic status, etc. We will explain all of this in more detail below.

We provide a platform where users can access courses on 10 different topics, including (Cybersecurity, UX Design, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Marketing, etc.). The platform is very user-friendly, and the software programs are highly affordable.

WEBSITE PURPOSE
Our brand's purpose is to democratize online education in such a way that we can make a significant impact on an ever-changing society, positively affecting people's lives and revolutionizing the industry with an innovative proposal. This includes allowing users to choose the mentor responsible for the selected course. We, as DevSchool, aim to have a moderate number of instructors, not exceeding 10, selected based on their qualifications and their relevance to the courses being offered. This provides confidence and security to our users, as they will know in advance who will be leading any course, and we can validate this by providing information to our visitors.

MAIN TARGET
DevSchool's main objective is to make it easier for people to access our services, thus transforming the lives of thousands, especially young individuals who find it more accessible to study through a platform rather than paying for a semester at a university. We also aim to provide a practical focus since we understand that the world is moving towards a more technological market. Therefore, DevSchool proposes to offer courses exclusively in technology, which are currently in high demand and well-paying careers. Initially, we are focusing on providing services this way, but our medium-term goal is to enable companies to have their own space for training their employees in the technology sector.

FEATURES IMPROVEMENTS
DevSchool plans to scale and enhance its functionalities, offering a broader range of services to the population. One of these functions is to integrate companies so that their employees can access courses to ensure they are continually learning. We plan to integrate a CRM system where users can have personalized profiles and access their subjects, providing a more user-centric service. DevSchool aims to have a closer relationship with its users, getting firsthand knowledge of the needs that can improve our service and quality in the market. This, in turn, can improve the lives of our young people, who currently face high unemployment rates and limited opportunities in today's job market. With this, we aim to contribute to society by improving the courses offered to our young population, who will ultimately shape the future through technological advancements.

WEBSITE EXPLANATION

In this first part, we can find the website's logo with a Poppins-style typography that instills confidence and credibility when the user enters. We've also added a search bar, some subpages like (plans and courses), along with flag buttons to change the website's language.

 
At the bottom of the header, there is a call to action with valuable information for the visitor, where they can see a button encouraging the user to click and take them to the section of interest to the user.

 
If we scroll down the page, we come across a section where we mention the main reason and inspiration for creating the website, providing valuable information for the customer.

 
Next, you can see a section where we highlight three of our fundamental pillars, which can be developed with our education: create, socialize, and innovate. Adding value to the interaction with the community.

 
One of our added values is specifically showcasing the teachers who will be conducting the courses, giving us an edge over the competition, as there is a common issue where users do not know in advance who will be teaching the course.

 
We have a chat section where users can interact with us as a company, along with our location, providing authenticity in the information displayed to the customer.

 
We have also decided to include a section of companies that can support the technology and English courses we are offering.
	
 
In this part, we reach the point of the courses we will offer to the community, arranging them by colors not with the intention of signifying anything about the learning path but as a user interaction with the page, something that stands out with the background color.

 
We continue with two sections, one with a call to action that, when clicked, will take users to the footer to add an email address, allowing us as DevSchool to send the user information of interest.

Below, you will find a section with validating opinions about the work being done on the website and its content. With this, we aim to provide validity, authenticity, and trust to the customer.

 
We reach the footer with additional information, including social media links, the input where the user will enter their email address, the website's rights, and at the bottom, DevSchool's pre-established data policies and treatment, which we make known to visitors, explaining how we will handle their information.
